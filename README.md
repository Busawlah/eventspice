# Eventspice
An event management system

##
### Question 
1. Create an event management system RESTFUL API:

User Story: As an event organizer, I want to create and manage events through a web platform. I should be able to:

Register and log in to the platform (I should get a welcome mail when I register).
Create new events with details such as name, date, location, description.
Manage attendees by adding, editing and removing attendees from the event (attendees should get a mail when they are added to or removed from an event).
Generate reports for each event with information about attendee count etc.

2. Integrate MongoDB Atlas to your application. 

3. As an admin, I want to be able to approve or reject events created  by users. If an event is rejected, the admin should provide a reason for the rejection, which will be sent to the user via email. I should be able to:

i. Log in to the platform.

ii. Approve or reject events.

iii. Delete events that are no longer needed.

iv. View a list of all the registered attendees for each event.

4. Push your codes to GitHub, deploy your app on Render.com and attach the live link to your GitHub repository. 

5. Document and publish your API with POSTMAN, attach the collection link alongside your Mailtrap login details to your GitHub README file. 

6. Submit the link to your GitHub repository.
